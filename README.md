# Noteit

A note-taking web app with cloud syncing.

## Deployment

You'll need NPM and Node installed, of course.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toasterpanic/noteit
cd noteit

npm install
```

From here, rename the `userdata_example` folder to `userdata`. Then,

```bash
npm start
```

## Configuration

You can edit the `config.yaml` file to change your server's configuration. All configuration options are documented inside the config. Once you have finished editing it, you must restart the server for the changes to take effect.

You can also edit configuration items for a user in the `usrconfig.yml` file of a user.
